First of all, I need to display a registration screen with: name and the technex id.

Once that is done, the user is redirected to a log in page, and then logs in, with the data being stored in the document.cookie field.

Once the user logs in, he/she is taken to the problems page, where the problems are displayed.
Along with a problem are fields for submition of his/her code, as well as specifying what languages are allowed.

These languages allowed are stored in a special database, and an admin user can remove what languages are allowed in each subsequent round.

Once the submission is made, a counter is increased for the corresponding language, which is displayed on a separate "stats" page.
